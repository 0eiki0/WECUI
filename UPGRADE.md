Upgrading WorldEditCUI
----------------------

Occasionally, WorldEditCUI will release an update in between Minecraft
release cycles. This means that class files will need to be rewritten,
replaced, and it will often break your client. 

Depending on your install method, upgrading will be slightly different.

- If you installed by actually moving the class files to minecraft.jar,
  you have no other options but to reinstall everything, including all
  of your other mods. To do this, open the Minecraft launcher, hit the
  "Options" button, and click "Force Update". This will redownload the
  minecraft.jar. From there, follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt.
- If you installed by moving the files to the mods/ folder, upgrading is
  far more simple. Simply delete your mods/WorldEditCUI folder, and follow
  the instructions in INSTALL.txt.

If anything breaks due to this update, you should start over with a clean
minecraft.jar before seeking help.
