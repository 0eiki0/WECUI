Upgrading WorldEditCUI
----------------------

Occasionally, WorldEditCUI will release an update in between Minecraft
release cycles. This means that class files will need to be rewritten,
replaced, and it will often break your client. 

To update, you have no other options but to reinstall everything, including all
of your other mods. To do this, open the Minecraft launcher, hit the
"Options" button, and click "Force Update". This will redownload the
minecraft.jar. From there, follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt.

If anything breaks due to this update, you should start over with a clean
minecraft.jar before seeking help.
